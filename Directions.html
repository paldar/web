			The rules of Othello are actually quite simple.

            Gameplay
        </h2>
        <p>
        Each of the disks' two sides corresponds to one player; they are referred 
		to here as light and dark after the sides of Othello pieces, but any counters
		with distinctive faces are suitable. The game may for example be played with a 
		chessboard and Scrabble pieces, with one player letters and the other backs.
        </p>
		<p>
		The game begins with four disks placed in a square in the middle of the grid,
		two facing white side up, two pieces with the dark side up, with same-colored 
		disks on a diagonal with each other. Convention has initial board position such
		that the disks with dark side up are to the north-east and south-west 
		(from both players' perspectives), though this is only marginally meaningful to 
		play. The dark player moves first.
		</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
				Dark must place a piece with the dark side up on the board, in such a position that there exists
				at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new piece and another dark piece,
				with one or more contiguous light pieces between them.
			</li>  
			
            <li>
				After placing the piece, dark turns over (flips, captures) all light pieces
				lying on a straight line between the new piece and any anchoring dark pieces. 
				All reversed pieces now show the dark side, and dark can use them in later movesâ€”unless
				light has reversed them back in the meantime. In other words, a valid move is one where
				at least one piece is reversed
			</li> 
			
			<li> 
				Now light plays. This player operates under the same rules, with the roles reversed: 
				light lays down a light piece, causing a dark piece to flip
			</li>
			<li>
				Players take alternate turns. The game ends when the grid has been filled up or 
				when a player cannot legally place a piece in any of the remaining squares. 
				This means the game may end before the grid is completely filled.
			</li>
        </ol>
