            Gameplay
        </h2>
        <p>
        The game is played on a square board divided into 20 rows and 20 columns, for a
        total of 400 squares. There are a total of 84 game tiles, organized into
        21 shapes in each of four colors: blue, yellow, red, and green. The 21
        shapes are based on free polyominoes of from one to five squares (one
        monomino, one domino, two trominoes/triominoes, five tetrominoes, and 12
        pentominoes).  The standard rules of play for all variations of the game
        are as follows: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Order of play is based on color, with blue going
            first, followed by yellow, red, and green.</li>  
            <li>The first piece played of
        each color is placed in one of the board's four corners. Each new piece
        played must be placed so that it touches at least one piece of the same
        color, with only corner-to-corner contact allowedâ€”edges cannot touch.
        However, edge-to-edge contact is allowed when two pieces of different
        color are involved.</li> 
        <li> When a player cannot place a piece, he or she
        passes, and play continues as normal. The game ends when no one can
        place a piece.
        </li>  
        </ol>
    <p>
    When a game ends, the score is based on the number of
        squares in each player's unplayed pieces; a player loses one point for
        each square (e.g. a tetromino is worth -4 points). If a player played
        all of his or her pieces, he or she gets a bonus score of +20 points if
        the last piece played was a monomino, +15 points otherwise.
        </p>
